## What data does Musician collect?
As there is not much functionality to the bot yet, we do not really need to store any actual data.
We only store one basic thing to make sure that everything functions properly.

| Collected Data | Usage & Purpose |
| :------------- | :----------: |
| Server IDs | Keeping track of saved server settings and playlist settings. |

### Do we share our collected data with anyone?

We do **NOT** share any of our user data, since we know how important privacy is for every one of us.

### I want to delete all my data, how am I able to do it?

There are 2 main options available to delete your data.
- You can either contact the developer on Discord (Astra#0001) providing your User ID / Server ID. Once the developer is online, your data will be deleted as soon as possible!
- Join our Discord [Support Server](https://discord.gg/ee54FNDW84) by using the `support` command, go to `#general` and mention your current state and issue. You will get support in less than 20 minutes.
